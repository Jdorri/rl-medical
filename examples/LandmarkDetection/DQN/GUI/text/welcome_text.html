    <p>Welcome to the <b>A</b>natomical <b>La</b>ndmark <b>D</b>etection and <b>D</b>emonstration <b>In</b>terface!
    ALADDIN is an interface for visualising landmark detection reinforcement learning (RL) agents trained on
    brain MRI, cardiac MRI, and fetal ultrasound 3D images. ALADDIN also facilitates Human-in-the-Loop (HITL)
    experimentation by facilitating human interaction with the enviroment and storing the results.</p><br />

    <h2 style='color:#009CBC'>Automatic mode</h2><br />
    In Automatic mode, you can visualise the learned policy of the agent on 2D projections
    and within a 3D volume.<br />

    <h2 style='color:#009CBC'>Browse mode</h2><br />
    In Browse mode, the user can select one of six possible actions to freely navigate through the 3D enviroment.<br />

    <h2 style='color:#009CBC'>HITL mode</h2><br />
    HITL mode allows a human expert to record steps in the enviroment towards an anatomical landmark. This data
    is automatically stored for further use in HITL experiments.<br />
