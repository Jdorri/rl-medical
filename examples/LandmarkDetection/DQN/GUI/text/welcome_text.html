    ALADDIN is a interface for visualising landmark detection reinforcement learning (RL) agents trained on
    brain MRI, cardiac MRI, and fetal ultrasound 3D images. ALADDIN also facilitates Human-in-the-Loop (HITL)
    experiments by storing human steps in the enviroment.</p><br />

    <h2 style='color:#009CBC'>Automatic Mode</h2><br />
    In Automatic mode, you can simultaneously visualise the learned policy of the agent on 2D projections
    and within a 3D volume.<br />

    <h2 style='color:#009CBC'>Browse Mode</h2><br />
    In Browse mode, the user can use one of the six possible actions to freely navigate through the 3D enviroment.<br />

    <h2 style='color:#009CBC'>HITL Mode</h2><br />
    HITL mode allows an human expert to record steps in the enviroment towards an anatomical landmark. This data
    is automatically stored for further use in HITL experiments.<br />
