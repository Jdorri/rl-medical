Instructions for using the HITL functionality to gather data for the
Human Replay Buffer.

- 1hr each should be enough

To begin HITL:
- Go to branch HITL_extension
- DQN folder
- Run functioning_UI_PyQt.py
- Click browse mode button
- Click on "Enable HITL" check box
- Click "Yes" for pop up window
Now HITL mode is enabled. States will be recorded from this point onward.

While in HITL mode:
- Move agent towards the target
- Click next image once "Error" = 0.0
- Can navigate by clicking arrows or using key bindings (much faster)
- IF YOU MAKE A MISTAKE, CLICK DELETE EPISODE (only removes current episode)
- Key bindings are as follows:
  - U, D, L, R = arrow keys
  - "a" / "s" = move in / move out (move along z-axis)
  - Space = next image
  - Backspace = delete episode
  - "+" / "-" = zoom in / zoom out
- Once finished, to save the HITL session, either: 1) close the GUI or 2) click on HITL check box (it will automatically save a pickle file in ./data/HITL)
- Git add and commit to add your HITL session to github

Additional points:
- You do not need to do this continuously (i.e. 4 x 15 min sessions is fine)
- To check how many HITL episodes you have done, end your HITL session (see line 27) and run "python3 -m inspect_HITL_buffer.py"
  - This will tell you how many episodes and states you have done
- There is a 50% chance the resolution will start on 2 or 3.  This is deliberate: otherwise resolution = 2 would occur often from the human.
- Try to do horizontal axis first then vertical then z-axis (in/out)
