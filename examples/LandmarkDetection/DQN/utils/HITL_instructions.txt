Instructions for using the HITL functionality to gather data for the
Human Replay Buffer.

To begin HITL:
- Go to branch HITL_extension
- DQN folder
- Run functioning_UI_PyQt.py
- Click browse mode button
- Click on "Enable HITL" check box
- Click "Yes" for pop up window
Now HITL mode is enabled. States will be recorded from this point onward.

While in HITL mode:
- Move agent towards the target
- Click next image once "Error" = 0.0
- Can navigate by clicking arrows or using key bindings (much faster)
- IF YOU MAKE A MISTAKE, CLICK DELETE EPISODE (only removes current episode)
- Key bindings are as follows:
  - up, down, left, right = w, s, a, d
  - z / x = move in / move out (move along z-axis)
  - n = next image
  - Backspace = delete episode
  - "+" / "-" = zoom in / zoom out
- Once finished, to save the HITL session, either: 1) close the GUI or 2) click on HITL check box (it will automatically save a pickle file in ./data/HITL)
- Git add and commit to add your HITL session to github
